# Product Description

This project is a template for a Next.js 15 application that provides a solid foundation for building a modern web application with a complete authentication system.

## Problem Solved
Starting a new web application project often involves significant boilerplate setup, especially for authentication. This template accelerates the initial development phase by providing a pre-configured, production-ready solution for user authentication, including:
- User sign-up and sign-in (email/password and Google OAuth).
- Secure session management.
- Protected routes.
- Password reset functionality.

## How it Works
The application serves as a landing page and a dashboard. Unauthenticated users are presented with a landing page and options to sign in or sign up. Once authenticated, users are redirected to a protected dashboard page.

The core user experience goals are:
- **Seamless Authentication**: Provide a smooth and secure login/signup experience.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Offer a clean, well-structured, and easily customizable codebase.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Utilize a modern design system (ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS) for a polished user interface.

## Target Audience
This template is intended for developers who want to quickly bootstrap a Next.js project with a robust authentication system already in place.
