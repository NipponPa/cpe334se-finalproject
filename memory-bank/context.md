Current work focus: Enhanced the calendar application with visual date selection indicators, multi-day event support, editable events functionality, and fixed date handling issues. The calendar now clearly indicates the target day for event creation, supports events spanning multiple days, allows users to edit existing events, and properly handles timezone conversions to prevent date shifting. Additionally, fixed the save functionality in the AddEventForm that wasn't working when the save button was pressed. The form now properly handles submission, saves events to the database, closes the form, and resets fields after successful save. Recently added comprehensive profile picture management system with Supabase storage, security policies, client-side optimization, and OAuth integration.
