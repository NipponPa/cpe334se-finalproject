# Context

- **Current Focus**: Implementing the database schema for the event/task management application
- **Recent Changes**: Updated memory bank files (brief.md, product.md, architecture.md, tech.md) to reflect the new application purpose as a centralized calendar system for managing events, tasks, and collaborations; created Supabase migration files with complete database schema including users, events, tasks, event_participants, user_preferences, and notifications tables with proper relationships and Row Level Security policies
- **Next Steps**: Update README.md, RELEASE_PLAN.md, and ADR documentation to align with the new application concept
