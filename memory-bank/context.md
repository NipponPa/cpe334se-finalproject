Current work focus: Implemented a comprehensive internal notification-based invite system to replace the previous email invitation functionality. The system now includes a notification utility module, updated FriendSelection component that only allows inviting registered users, enhanced AddEventForm that creates internal notifications instead of sending emails, and a new NotificationDropdown component that allows users to accept or decline event invitations directly from the notification bell. The Supabase Edge Function was updated to create internal notifications only for registered users, and external email functionality was completely removed. The NavigationBar was updated to integrate with the new notification system, providing users with real-time notification counts and response capabilities. Additionally, fixed a critical error where notifications were being created with temporary event IDs by updating the flow to create events in the database first, then create notifications with the actual event ID. Also created a migration to address RLS policy issues that were preventing notifications from being created for invited users. Most recently, implemented username handling during signup that connects the input to both the display name in Supabase authentication and the full name in the user table, ensuring consistency across the application. The signup flow now captures the username and stores it in both locations, with appropriate error handling if the user table update fails. Most recently updated the profile page to replace the user ID with full name display and swapped the position of the Full Name and Email fields for better user experience.
