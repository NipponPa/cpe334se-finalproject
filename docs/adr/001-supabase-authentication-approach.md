# Architecture Decision Record: Supabase Authentication Implementation

## Title
Use Supabase for Authentication in Next.js Application

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our Next.js application requires a robust authentication system to secure user data and provide personalized experiences. We need to decide on an authentication approach that balances development speed, security, maintainability, and scalability.

## Decision
We will implement authentication using Supabase for the following reasons:

### Technical Requirements
- Need to support email/password authentication
- Requirement for OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Server-side rendering compatibility
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Session management
- Protected route implementation

### Frameworks and Libraries Chosen
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4
- **Runtime Environment**: React 19.1.0
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication Library**: Supabase JavaScript client library (@supabase/supabase-js v2.75.0)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL database
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Tailwind Merge for class composition

### Session Strategy
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Supabase uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management
- **Client-side Storage**: Session tokens are stored in browser storage and managed by the Supabase client
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Supabase handles token refresh automatically to maintain user sessions
- **Secure Token Handling**: Tokens are stored securely and included in requests automatically

### User Record Storage
- **Database**: User records are stored in Supabase's PostgreSQL database
- **Authentication Tables**: Supabase automatically manages authentication tables (auth.users, auth.identities)
- **User Profiles**: Additional user profile data can be stored in custom tables linked to auth.users
- **Security**: Database access is controlled through Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Redirect URIs
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:3000
- **Production**: https://[domain].com (to be configured based on deployment)
- **OAuth Callbacks**: Configured in Supabase dashboard for each OAuth provider
- **Auth Callback Path**: /auth/callback (standard path for handling authentication redirects)

### Why Supabase?
1. **Rapid Development**: Supabase provides a complete authentication backend without requiring custom server implementation
2. **Built-in Security**: Handles password hashing, session management, and security best practices out-of-the-box
3. **Database Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Supabase's PostgreSQL database for user profiles and related data
4. **OAuth Support**: Easy integration with popular OAuth providers
5. **Real-time Capabilities**: Can leverage real-time features for collaborative applications in the future
6. **Scalability**: Managed infrastructure that scales automatically
7. **Type Safety**: Excellent TypeScript support with generated types

## Implementation Approach
1. Use Supabase JavaScript client library
2. Create authentication context for state management
3. Implement protected route components
4. Build login/signup UI components
5. Configure environment variables for Supabase credentials

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced development time for authentication features
- Industry-standard security practices
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Built-in user management dashboard
- Potential to leverage additional Supabase features (database, storage, real-time)

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to Supabase platform
- Additional external dependency
- Monthly costs that scale with usage
- Less control over authentication implementation details

### Neutral
- Learning curve for Supabase platform features
- Requires internet connectivity for authentication

## Alternatives Considered

### NextAuth.js
- Pros: Popular, excellent Next.js integration, many providers
- Cons: Requires additional setup, self-managed session handling

### Custom JWT Implementation
- Pros: Full control over authentication flow, no vendor lock-in
- Cons: More complex implementation, security responsibility, session management complexity

### Firebase Authentication
- Pros: Mature platform, good documentation
- Cons: Vendor lock-in to Google, potential cost considerations

## Decision Drivers
- Time-to-market requirements
- Security best practices
- Team familiarity with Supabase
- Integration with existing tech stack
- Scalability needs

## Related Decisions
- Tech stack includes Next.js with TypeScript
- Docker containerization approach
- Potential future use of Supabase database features

## Notes
This decision aligns with our goal of rapid development while maintaining security standards. Supabase provides a good balance between control and convenience for our authentication needs.
