# E2E Testing Setup - Playwright Documentation

## Tool Choice: Playwright

### Rationale for Choosing Playwright

Playwright was selected as the E2E testing framework for this project due to its comprehensive features and capabilities:

- **Cross-browser support**: Tests can run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Modern web features**: Handles modern web technologies like Single Page Applications
- **Reliability**: Built-in auto-waiting and web-first assertions
- **Speed**: Fast execution with parallel test running
- **Developer experience**: Excellent debugging tools and detailed test reports
- **API testing**: Can test both frontend and backend APIs
- **Mobile emulation**: Supports testing on different device sizes

## Installation Process

### Installation Commands

```bash
# Install Playwright as a development dependency
npm i -D @playwright/test

# Install browsers needed for testing
npx playwright install

# Run tests in UI mode (recommended for development)
npx playwright test --ui

# Alternative: Run tests in headless mode
npx playwright test
```

## First Run Screenshot

For the first run documentation, capture a screenshot showing:
1. The terminal output after running `npx playwright test --ui`
2. The Playwright UI interface displaying available tests
3. Browser windows opened by Playwright during test execution
4. The test results dashboard after test completion

The screenshot should demonstrate that:
- Playwright is properly installed and configured
- Tests are discoverable by the framework
- Browser automation is working correctly
- Test execution completes successfully

## Expected First Run Experience

When running `npx playwright test --ui` for the first time, you should see:
- A browser window opening with the Playwright Test UI
- Available test files listed in the left panel
- Browser windows opening to run the actual tests
- Real-time test execution status updates
- Detailed test reports upon completion

## Additional Configuration

After installation, you may need to initialize Playwright with:
```bash
npx playwright init
```

This will create:
- `playwright.config.ts` - Configuration file
- `tests/` directory - For test files
- Example test file to get started
